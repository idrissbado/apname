## ðŸ“œ Instructions Followed  

1. **Project Setup**  
   - Created a new React project using `create-react-app`.

2. **Installed Dependencies**  
   - Installed **Axios** for API requests using:  
     ```bash
     npm install axios
     ```
   
3. **Fetched User Data from API**  
   - Used **jsonplaceholder** API to fetch user data:  
     ```
     https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
     ```
   - Used the **useEffect** hook to trigger the API call when the component mounts.  
   - Stored the fetched data in state using the **useState** hook.  

4. **Displayed the User List**  
   - Mapped through `listOfUser` state to display each user on the screen.  
   - Rendered user details in a structured format.
